currently on the journey of learning react so making some simple project to test my knowledge
Simple todo app  (only user interface) since used only react

has a container :
>first use---to display the entered  todo list
>second use--- to display completed todo .. since you deleted that means it is completed

Functions:-
          >  You can add items
          > remove the item

Components :-
>App.jsx           main component
>AppName.jsx       { display app name}
>AddTodo.jsx      {   contain (inputfield, input date, button to add)}
>Heading.jsx       {  disply container heading}
>TodoItems_container.jsx        
    >TodoItem.jsx     
    >Delbutton.jsx    { created separate as want to use todo_container  mulytiple times}
